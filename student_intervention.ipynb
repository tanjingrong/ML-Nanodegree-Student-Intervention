The different training set sizes are factored into the model such that we can make comparisons of the training and prediction time taken as well as the consistency of the F1 scores as training sizes increases. Generally we look out for consistent F1 scores even as training sizes increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and Prediction time estimates the duration that is required for these tests to be carried out. We look out for the shortest time possible for these tests to be carried out but expects duration to increase as training set size increases. The faster the time taken for the training and the test, the less costly it will be in terms of resource expanded and opportunity cost incurred in the event the prediction time affects the costs of operation (e.g electronic trading of financial derivatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is a measure of accuracy of these tests with 0 being no accuracy at all an 1 being extremely accurate and precise. F1 scores between training data is compared with the test data to ensure that when testing the model on data that was not used to train the model (new and unexpected data), the F1 score remains close to 1- meaning, the trained model can actually predict future values that are accurate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Decision Tree Classifier returned a perfect training F1 score in all three training set sizes but returned the poorest set of testing F1 score with a range of 0.683 to 0.746. This can be explained by overfitting. As the classifier itself is prone to the problem of overfitting in presence of a sufficiently large number of features, we can thus conclude that the number of features in this data set is more than the ideal number for this particular size of data results in overfitting. F1 scores for this classifier is also the most inconsistent. It is also worth noting that this model has the fastest prediction time amongst the three. Overfitting can be solved but will not be explored in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes Classifier returned the fastest training time ranging from 0.0019 to 0.0023 seconds. This is inline with expectations as described in question 2 that this classifier will be able to generate models extremely fast.This Classifier is faster than SVC by almost 2 to 3 times. The tight range of training time also explains its high scalability. Unfortunately, this model returns the poorest range of F1 test scores between 0.6726 and 0.777.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Classifier has the longest training and prediction time but gives the best F1 scores that is both accurate (high in value) and consistent within the 3 training sets and when comparing the scores between test and training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, SVC is the most ideal and appropriate model. In this particular project, we are to accurately determine which students are likely to fail to graduate and intervene beforehand, thus accuracy is of the highest priority for this purpose. Besides, for all 3 models, the time take for both prediction and training are less than 1 second. The evaluation is conducted only after the data set has been collected for some time and is not ongoing. Thus, with a processing time of less than 1 second, I would say even the slowest SVC model is pretty fast for this purpose."

Notice that there are an infinite number of lines that will accomplish this task. SVCs, in particular, find the \"maximum-margin\" line - the middle line. We draw a straight line through the data(all the students mixed up) through the middle to separate it into two classes, pass and fail and in the process try to maximize the diagonal distance between the 2 groups.To draw the maximum margin line, only the data points closest to the line matter. These points are known as \"support vectors\" which gives SVC its name as seen in the image below.\n",

As it undergoes training with more new data passed along the classifier, it will attempt to optimize the maximum margin line and it may change shape, into curves in the process as various points close to the support vectors are \"lifted\" to a higher dimension onto a hyperplane (no longer 2D). Through this repetitive process, the maximum margin line is optimized and will be capable of separating the 2 groups very accurately and clearly as the margin width is being maximally stretched(see picture above) within its optimized parameters. Thus this will result in a distinct separator that is very capable of accurately separating students who are likely to graduate and those who will not. "
